# QueryBot 5000
**QueryBot 5000 (QB5000)** is a  robust forecasting framework that allows a DBMS to predict the expected arrival rate of queries
in the future based on historical data. This is the source code for our 
[SIGMOD paper](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~malin199/publications/2018.forecasting.sigmod.pdf): **_Query-based Workload Forecasting for Self-Driving Database Management Systems_**.
(my testing)
## Framework Pipeline:

### Anonymization
We first anonymize all the queries from the real-world traces used in our experiments for privacy purposes. The components below use the anonymization results from this step as their input.

    cd anonymizer
    ./log-anonymizer.py --help
    
### Pre-processor
This component extracts the **template**s from the anonymized queries and records the arrival rate history for each template.

    cd pre-processor
    ./templatizer.py --help
    
### Clusterer
This component groups query templates with similar arrival rate patterns into **cluster**s.

    cd clusterer
    ./online_clustering.py --help
_generate-cluster-coverage.py_ generates the time series for the largest _MAX_CLUSTER_NUM_ clusters on each day, which are used in the forecasting evaluation.
    
### Forecaster
This component uses a combination of linear regression, recurrent neural network, and kernel regression to predict the arrival rate pattern of each query cluster on different prediction **horizon**s and **interval**s.

    cd forecaster
    ./exp_multi_online_continuous.py --help
 
### Workload Simulator
This simulator populates a synthetic database with a given schema file, removes all the secondary indexes, replays the query trace of the workload, and builds appropriate indexes with the real-time workload forecasting results.

    cd workload-simulator
    ./workload-simulator.py --help
    
## NOTE
This repo does not have an end-to-end running framework. We build different components separately and pass the results through a workload simulator that connects to MySQL/PostgreSQL for experimental purposes. We are integrating the full framework into [Peloton](http://pelotondb.io/) Self-Driving DBMS. Please check out our [source code](https://github.com/cmu-db/peloton/tree/master/src/include/brain) there for more reference.
